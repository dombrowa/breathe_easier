### HELP seeking
1. FDA approval process experts
2. Legal experts in medical device
3. Medical professionals (family doctors, nurses) with expertise in Stethoscope diagnosis
4. 3d printer owners, designers and hobbyists
5. Distribution channel and supply chain resources


## Introduction
We create an affordable, 3d-printable, pure mechanical adapter to connect any stethoscope with smartphone's microphone.

We are facing a crisis of COVID-19 outbreak. Many infected people are quarantined at home because the scarcity of hospital capacity. But these people still needs medical attention. Doctors are monitoring them through telemedicine platforms.

COVID-19 is a respiratory disease. Lune infections and congestions are the major dangerous to people's life. Currently, doctors can only monitor patients via asking about symptoms and body temperature, to infer the patient's conditions. 

Stethoscope is a traditional and proven device for diagnosting respiratory conditions.

The purpose of this project is to design a 3D-printable adapter for people to connect stethoscope with smartphone's microphone, so that doctors can instruct patients or their caregivers to put stethoscope on patient's chest and listen for breathing sound to monitor patient's lung condition. 

Hopefully, it will let the quarantined patients have an ease-of-mind and breathe eaiser knowing that they are being taken care of.
