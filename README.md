### HELP seeking
1. FDA approval process experts
2. Legal experts in medical devices
3. Medical professionals (family doctors, nurses) with expertise in Stethoscope diagnosis
4. 3D printer owners, designers and hobbyists
5. Distribution channel and supply chain resources


## Introduction
We create an affordable, 3D-printable, pure mechanical adapter to connect any stethoscope to a smartphone's microphone.

We are facing a crisis of COVID-19 outbreak. Many infected people are quarantined at home because the scarcity of hospital capacity. But these people still need medical attention. Doctors are monitoring them through telemedicine platforms.

COVID-19 is a respiratory disease. Lung infections and congestions are most dangerous to people's life. Currently, doctors can only monitor patients by asking about symptoms and body temperature, to infer the patient's conditions. 

Stethoscope is a traditional and proven device for diagnosting respiratory conditions.

The purpose of this project is to design a 3D-printable adapter for people to connect a stethoscope to a smartphone's microphone, so that doctors can instruct patients or caregivers to put a stethoscope on a patient's chest and listen for breathing sound to monitor patient's lung condition. 

Hopefully, it will let the quarantined patients have an ease-of-mind and breathe eaiser knowing that they are being taken care of.
